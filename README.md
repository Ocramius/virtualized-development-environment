Virtualized Development Environment
=====

This repository (and it's branches) represent a development environment I am currently using to work with at my daytime job and also for side OSS projects.
It will be configured slowly to support the various programming languages and daemons/diagnostic/deployment tools I use to work with. For now, it will just host a simple LAMP stack built on top of Vagrant and Chef.

This is currently a work in progress, not a repository you can fork to have a fully configured development environment in seconds.
